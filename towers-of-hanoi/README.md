# Towers of Hanoi Coding Challenge

## What is the problem?

The Towers of Hanoi is a popular coding challenge. For those who haven't heard of it, here's a brief introduction to it:

```
The tower of Hanoi (commonly also known as the "towers of Hanoi"), is a puzzle invented by E. Lucas in 1883. It is also known as the Tower of Brahma puzzle and appeared as an intelligence test for apes in the film Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) under the name "Lucas Tower."

Given a stack of n disks arranged from largest on the bottom to smallest on top placed on a rod, together with two empty rods, the tower of Hanoi puzzle asks for the minimum number of moves required to move the stack from one rod to another, where moves are allowed only if they place smaller disks on top of larger disks.

## What is the solution?

Whatever you want it to be. This is intended to be one of a series of coding challenges, a refresher to the Java programming language. We ask you to stick to JDK8, as that's what will be used henceforth, but feel free to tackle this problem in any way you feel comfortable

There will be a sort of skeleton code, for consistency sake with the rest of this course but feel free to deviate from it as you see fit: the marking of these challenges won't be automated but will be overseen by an actual person
