# Introduction to Middleware with Java

## Day 1

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will:

1. Understand what Git is and how it works

2. Be able to navigate through branches and make pull requests in GitHub

3. Be able to apply Java concepts to solve interview style questions

### Assessment

1. Students will clone a repository, branch, create a new commit and push to a remote repository.

2. Students will open a pull request in GitHub

3. Students will successfully complete 3 coding challenges

### Reading

In this section, we'll learn what Git is and how you'll be using it to complete the rest of these sprints in this project.

* [Understanding the Git Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

    * This explain what the Git Workflow is, and what your workflow will be once you start fully taking advantage of Git to work collaboratively in a team 

* [Wait, so what is Git again?](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)

    * This will detail all the major features of Git, including what is a repository and common Command Line Interface commands. It will also reirate on a few other points already mentioned, in case you need a refresher.

* [Let's fork that repo!](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)

    * This guide will take you through the steps of forking a repository, so you can start working on your version of the activities

* [Let's also learn to create beautiful markdown documentation](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

    * This will purely help you get a grip on writing readme files using markdown, which is what GitHub uses.

* All instructions for activities will be inside the corresponding folder, in the README.md file.

### Branching, committing and pushing in Git

* Branching is essentially creating a copy of your current repository. When you branch, you allow yourself the ability to add or edit features, without touching the main codebase and accidentally breaking your main project.

    * [What a branch is](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Branching-What-a-Branch-Is)

    * [Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch)

* Committing is adding your changed files and creating a new version of your codebase. You usually commit with a message so both you and other developers know what has changed without looking at the entire codebase.

    * [What is committing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#Committing-Your-Changes)

    * [Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit)

* Pushing is adding the committed files to your existing codebase. You can push to the master branch, or where the most recent build of your project lives, or to a branch, to test or edit features.

    * [What is Pushing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes)

    * [Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push)

### GitHub and Pull Requests

* GitHub allows you to open Pull Requests against a repository, either your own or someone else's. This is essentially a way to ask for other developers to review and either approve or request changes to your commit. This process happens through the GitHub platform.

    * [More on Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)

### Activities

You can find each activity in its own separate folder in the repo.

* Hanoi Towers

* FizzBuzz

* Sudoku solver

### Demonstrations

* Start by forking the repository and adding it to your account. 

* Clo

* Create a new folder, inside /answers, with your username, i.e. /fb-test-1/answers/stdlibdoh

* Once you're done with the activities, create a new branch in your forked repository, named:

* Add and commit to this branch and submit a pull request against the master branch.

###Â Your Tasks

* Start with forking the original repository to your own account, from GitHub

* Login to your workspace instance

* Using the built-in terminal, clone the repo you just cloned, to your workspace

* Once you're done editing the skeleton code, create a new branch, named

```
your_username + day_of_activity, i.e. stdlibdoh-day1
```

* Add, commit and push to the newly created branch

* Once the previous steps are done, go on GitHub and open a pull request against the original repository

* Await for a reviewer to approve and merge your pull request

* Get bonus points!
