# Introduction to Middleware with Java

## Day 1

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will:

1. Understand what Git is and how it works

2. Be able to navigate through branches and make pull requests in GitHub

3. Be able to apply Java concepts to solve interview style questions

### Assessment

1. Students will clone a repository, branch, create a new commit and push to a remote repository.
2. Students will open a pull request in GitHub
3. Students will successfully complete 3 coding challenges

### Reading

* [Understanding the Git Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

    * This explain what the Git Workflow is, and what your workflow will be once you start fully taking advantage of Git to work collaboratively in a team 

* [Wait, so what is Git again?](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)

    * This will detail all the major features of Git, including what is a repository and common Command Line Interface commands. It will also reirate on a few other points already mentioned, in case you need a refresher.

* [Let's fork that repo!](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)

    * This guide will take you through the steps of forking a repository, so you can start working on your version of the activities

* [Let's also learn to create beautiful markdown documentation](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

    * This will purely help you get a grip on writing readme files using markdown, which is what GitHub uses.

* All instructions for activities will be inside the corresponding folder, in the README.md file.

### Activities

You can find each activity in its own separate folder in the repo.

* Hanoi Towers

* FizzBuzz

* Sudoku solver

### Demonstrations

* Start by forking the repository and adding it to your account. 

* Create a new folder, inside /answers, with your username, i.e. /fb-test-1/answers/stdlibdoh

* Once you're done with the activities, create a new branch in your forked repository, named:

```
your_username + day_of_activity, i.e. stdlibdoh-day1
``` 

* Add and commit to this branch and submit a pull request against the master branch.
