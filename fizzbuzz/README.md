# FizzBuzz Coding Challenge

## What is the problem?

Even though FizzBuzz is a seemingly straightforward coding challenge, it is still widely used as an interview question. For those who haven't heard of it, here's a brief introduction to it:

```
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
```

## What is the solution?

Whatever you want it to be. This is intended to be one of a series of coding challenges, a refresher to the Java programming language. We ask you to stick to JDK8, as that's what will be used henceforth, but feel free to tackle this problem in any way you feel comfortable

There will be a sort of skeleton code, for consistency sake with the rest of this course but feel free to deviate from it as you see fit: the marking of these challenges won't be automated but will be overseen by an actual person
