# Sudoku Solver Coding Challenge

## What is the problem?

Sudoku is a popular logic game, popularised in several print and digital mediums. A coding approach to solving it can take many forms, with different algorithms being used for this purpose, from brute force to more arguably elevant solutions./

```
Sudoku, also called Number Place, is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

## What is the solution?

Whatever you want it to be. This is intended to be one of a series of coding challenges, a refresher to the Java programming language. We ask you to stick to JDK8, as that's what will be used henceforth, but feel free to tackle this problem in any way you feel comfortable

There will be a sort of skeleton code, for consistency sake with the rest of this course but feel free to deviate from it as you see fit: the marking of these challenges won't be automated but will be overseen by an actual person
